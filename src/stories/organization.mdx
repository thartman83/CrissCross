# Story Organization
The various elements of the application are broken down as follows
  - UI Elements <br/>
  This is the most basic element, basically an atom in the atomic design system.
  - Composite Elements <br/>
  Any unit that consists of one or more UI elements in a coordinated
pattern
  - Containers <br />
  Common elements that serve as containers for other elements
  - Layouts <br />
  Complex set of elements that require elements to work in concert
with one another.

## UI Elements
Basic components of the application.

While not quite atomic, a UI Element is the smallest unit of component within the application. These elements tend to have very little in terms of logic if any at all and are primarily basic form elements used throughout the application.

## Composite Elements
Any component that is made up of one or more elements. Composite Elements similar to ui elements do not contain any logic and are primarily used for consistant styling and appearance.

## Layouts
Layouts consist of one or more UI elements and/or composite elements that interact with one an other in a defined and consistant way.

# CrissCross
A single page react application for crossword constructing. This set of storybooks is designed to provide documentation, testing, and example interactions of the various components of the application

# Story Organization
The various elements of the application are broken down as follows
  - UI Elements
  - Composite Elements
  - Layouts

## UI Elements
Basic components of the application.

While not quite atomic, a UI Element is the smallest unit of component within the application. These elements tend to have very little in terms of logic if any at all and are primarily basic form elements used throughout the application.

## Composite Elements
Any component that is made up of one or more elements. Composite Elements similar to ui elements do not contain any logic and are primarily used for consistant styling and appearance.

## Layouts
Layouts consist of one or more UI elements and/or composite elements that interact with one an other in a defined and consistant way.
